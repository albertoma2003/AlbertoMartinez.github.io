							<article id="intro">
								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/eptx.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas and am a first-generation Hispanic pursuing a degree away from home. I enjoy to run, spend time with family and friends, work on my programming skills, and explore the world of game development </a>.</p>
								<p> I just conlcuded this past summer as a Systems Engineer Intern at Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages, successfully implementing a water conservation project that limits the facilities daily water usage to under 250,000 gallons of water.
									Working alongside two other interns and two project managers, I not only learned the importance of communication skills and taking initiative, but on how to be detail-oriented when it comes to performing tasks to help reach a common goal.
								</p>
								<p> I also currently hold two leadership positions as a Student Mentor for SEEK (Student Engineers Educating Kids) and as a Fundraising Chair for SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers). These positions play a pivotal role in my every day life as they continue to help me work on my leadership skills and allow me to showcase some of my expertise outside the classroom in my communities. 
									Some of these capabilities include decision making, adaptability, creativity, active listening, and problem-solving skills. 
								</p>
								<p> I am extremely grateful for the opportunities that have been presented to me as they have shaped the person I am today am looking forward to future opportunities that will shape the man I aspire to be in my career after school.

						<!-- Software Projetcs -->
							<article id="work">
								<h2 class="major">Software Projetcs </h2>
								<p>Provided below are a few of my completed software projects that showcase some of my Object-Oriented Programming skills through Java and C++.</p>
								
								

								<h2 class="minor">Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</h2>
								<p>C++</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/crmm.webp" alt="" /></span>
								<p> In this project, I developed a customized inventory and customer relationship management system for a hypothetical small company. I implemented 3 C++ classes and incorporated features such as processInventory(), processPurchase(), and processSummarize() with error handling and dynamically allocated memory.</p>
								
								<h3> Why did I choose to do this project? </h3>
								<p> I undertook this project to experience the responsibilities of a software developer in a small company or startup. Linking programming projects to real-world situations not only motivates me to master the material but also encourages efficiency.</p>
								
								<h3> What was my biggest challnge? </h3>
								<p> My primary challenge in this project was implementing the database class, as the project's functionality depended on it. The database class stored data for valid purchases (excluding $0 purchases) and was dynamically allocated on the heap. I approached this challenge incrementally, writing and debugging functions one at a time to ensure the database class updated correctly and tracked changes in memory, local, and static variables. </p>

								<h3> What was my most significant takeaway? </h3>
								<p> My key lesson from this project is the importance of sketching out your implementation ideas using pseudo-code before diving into coding. This practice promotes clean code and simplifies debugging, as you can refer back to your initial sketch. This lesson has already proven valuable in subsequent projects and will continue to enhance my coding skills in future internships or full-time positions.</p>

								<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

								<h2 class="minor">Mortgage Calculator with Payment Schedule</h2>
								<p>Java</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mortgage.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> In this project, I developed a mortgage calculator with robust error handling, enabling user input validation for loan amounts within the range of $1,000 to $1,000,000, and for positive integer values between 0 and 30 years for both annual interest rate and loan repayment period. The project also includes a comprehensive payment schedule feature that dynamically displayed the remaining loan balance after each monthly payment, factoring in the interest rate for accurate tracking of loan repayment progress.</p>

								<h3> Why did I choose to do this project? </h3>
								<p> I undertook this project to apply my early Java skills by simulating a common real-world scenario. With 42% of American households having mortgages (over 51.5 million households), I aimed to create a tool that not only calculates mortgage payments but also generates a detailed payment schedule, accounting for monthly interest rates and a 30-year maximum term.</p>

								<h3> What was my biggest challnge? </h3>
								<p> My main challenge was implementing monthly payments while accounting for the monthly interest rate using complex formulas. To overcome this hurdle, I broke the formula into four segments, debugging each one separately. This step-by-step approach not only ensured accurate outputs but also deepened my understanding of the Java libraries. Debugging along the way, rather than postponing it, was key to successfully completing the project.</p>

								<h3> What was my most significant takeaway? </h3>
								<p> My key takeaway was the importance of leveraging built-in Java libraries effectively. Many people shy away from them due to fear of misuse. I embraced these libraries, such as java.util, java.lang, and java.math, learning through trial and error, even when mistakes led to incorrect outputs.</p>

								<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>


								<h2 class="minor">Space Invaders</h2>
								<p>C/C++</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/space invaders.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Created a single-player Space Invaders video game from scratch in C that runs on a TM4C MCU, displayed on a TFT LCD. The video game includes a START screen, a gameplay display, and a GAME OVER screen with a final score and leaderboard. Designed the sprites, sound effects, and utilized a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) as well as LED's and switches.</p>

								<h3> Why did I choose to do this project? </h3>
								<p> I built this project out of my deep passion for game development. I'm captivated by the creativity and dedication evident in every aspect of video games, from the visuals to the sound effects. Recreating Space Invaders from scratch allowed me to channel that same level of passion into my own project.</p>

								<h3> What was my biggest challnge? </h3>
								<p> My primary challenge was managing the movement of bullets shot by the spaceship and enemies. To resolve this, I created a regular bullet sprite and a black one to prevent a visible trail. Debugging the bullet movement code was demanding but enlightening, giving me a deeper appreciation for the effort behind my favorite video games.</p>

								<h3> What was my most significant takeaway? </h3>
								<p> My key takeaway was the comprehensive understanding required to develop a game like Space Invaders. From sprite creation to sound design, multiple screens, high score systems, and more, it's a complex process. This project significantly improved my skills and knowledge, benefiting even my non-game development projects in the future.</p>

						<!-- Software Projects contd -->
						<article id="work2">
							<h2 class="major">Software Projetcs Continued </h2>
								<p> Provided below are a few of my completed software projects that showcase my Hardware Description Language skills through Verilog, and some general programming expertise through C.</p>

								<h2 class="minor">Stopwatch/Timer Design</h2>
								<p>Verilog</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/timer.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Programmed a Stopwatch/timer from scratch that had four modes: counting up from 00.00, counting up from an externally loaded value, counting down from 99.99, and counting down from an externally loaded value. Utilized two buttons, 10 switches, a clock, and four seven-segment displays to display time on a Basys3 FPGA board.</p>
								
								<h3> Why did I choose to do this project? </h3>
								<p> I chose this project because stopwatches and timers have been essential tools in my life, especially during my time as a competitive runner in cross country and track and field. Bringing this practical experience into my software programming passion was a rewarding full-circle moment.</p>
								
								<h3> What was my biggest challnge? </h3>
								<p> My main challenge was adjusting the clock frequencies for the four required 7-segment displays. Without the correct frequencies, the project couldn't be completed. To conquer this hurdle, I sought assistance from teacher assistants and classmates, delved into clock frequencies and dividers, and persevered through trial and error until I resolved the issue. </p>

								<h3> What was my most significant takeaway? </h3>
								<p> My key takeaway from this project is the importance of not seeking shortcuts in programming. Investing time in debugging, seeking a deeper understanding of challenging concepts, and choosing the right approach has proven invaluable. This approach has not only benefited my current projects but also motivated my growth as a young programmer.</p>

								<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

								<h2 class="minor">Traffic Light Controller</h2>
								<p>C</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/traffic-lights better.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Developed a Traffic Light Controller for a 4-way intersection and pedestrian cross-walks to simulate a real world traffic scenario. Implemented finite state machines and array of structs to simulate and prioritize the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Demonstrated expertise in hardware testing and verification by utilizing a Digital Logic Analyzer and Oscilloscope to ensure optimal system performance.</p>
								
								<h3> Why did I choose to do this project? </h3>
								<p> I chose this project to simulate ideal scenarios at 4-way intersections, including pedestrian crosswalks. These intersections are involved in 40% of the over six million road accidents annually in the United States. Creating and learning about this crucial, albeit perilous, aspect of daily life intrigued me and offered a fun opportunity to develop my skills.</p>
								
								<h3> What was my biggest challnge? </h3>
								<p> My main challenge was synchronizing pedestrian crosswalks with the right-of-way while aiming for realism. I addressed this challenge by meticulously ensuring that all cars and pedestrians had sufficient time to reach their destinations, providing clear warnings to stop. I incorporated three white and red flashing lights for pedestrians and extended the duration of the yellow light for cars to enhance awareness of the situation. </p>

								<h3> What was my most significant takeaway? </h3>
								<p> My key takeaway from this project is the importance of connecting projects to real-world scenarios. This connection not only fuels motivation but also enhances creativity and curiosity in both future projects and everyday life beyond programming. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in finite state machines, successfully implementing one with 14 states and integrating a simple timer (SysTick) for fixed time-delays.</p>
